Tried to organize each section into markdown cells, some of them contain a couple topics and some topics are referenced in a couple markdown cells.

The topics generally go in order and the associated data/analysis/visualizations for each section are typically found beneath it's markdown cells before the next markdown cell or in the cell directly above.

Also tried to seperate different points by paragraph.
